# CS-Projects-By-Year

## Description  
This repository is a curated collection of beginner, intermediate, and advanced computer science projectsâ€”organized by academic year. These projects serve two goals:

1. Help **students** find inspiration and templates for their own learning or GitHub portfolios.
2. Showcase my own journey and knowledge as I apply what I've learned throughout my Computer Science degree.

Each project includes clear documentation, a structured folder layout, and learning outcomes for anyone who wants to explore, build, or extend the project.

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks / Tools**: Flask (others to be added as needed)
